                With a quick injection of a very small dose you can see the effects in as little as 10 months, the delayed effect is to keep <br>
                the identity of the Pranker a secret, They'll never know its you. The dosage can be administered through a needle, or <br>
                drippped into a cup</h3>

           <h1>Stage 3</h1>
            
            <p>Stage 3 is a further advanced version of the Cancer, this means that they would have to treat the cancer immedietly or <br>
                risk severe pain fro the rest of their life. our suggestion is to give this serum to homeless or people in extreme poverty <br>
                becasue this makes it so they are unable to get aid immedietly and they leave it untreated for years. This is the best way <br>
                to ensure practical and complete use of the Cancer, and get its best use out of it.</p>

            <h1>Stage 2</h1>

            <p>Stage 2 is a slightly more advanced version of Stage 1. This allows the cancer to take hold way quicker and make the victem <br>
                unaware until the cancer has progressed significantly. This version is a more agressive version of the Cancer making it very <br>
                effecient at depleting human cells, however the symtoms show up visibly a bit later than that of Stage 3 taking up to 2 years <br>
                 to show results, this can be advantagious because this gives you time to create a false identity and select a fall guy.
